In a separate pot, heat some oil and add the green onions, ginger, garlic, star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, and black cardamom. Stir-fry until fragrant. Then, add the Pixian Doubanjiang and continue to stir-fry until the oil turns red.\n\n3. Add the beef chunks to the pot and stir-fry until slightly browned. Add the dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, and Chinese cooking wine, stirring to coat the beef evenly.\n\n4. Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato ketchup, and rock sugar to the pot, stirring to combine. Pour in the reserved beef broth and transfer everything to a pressure cooker. Cook on low heat for 40 minutes.\n\n5. After the pressure has released, open the lid and season with salt. Cook on high heat to reduce the sauce to your desired consistency. If serving with noodles, leave a bit more broth in the pot.\n\n6. To serve, cook your choice of noodles according to package instructions. In a serving bowl, ladle some beef soup over the cooked noodles. Add a spoonful of the beef and sauce, and garnish with your choice of vegetables or cilantro. Enjoy!"}
